# Classify-Review-Sentiment-with-NLP

This project objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative using thousands of single-sentence reviews from amazon.com, imdb.com, and yelp.com. I applied 2 NLP methods, which are bag of words and word embeddings. The goal is to build binary classifiers which will generate new sentiment-lables for new sentences, helping automate the assessment process. 
  For each method, I used several classifiers, namely logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron, and SVM. To measure model performances, I used accuracy score, error rate, and AUROC.
